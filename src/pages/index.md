    From the dawn of time, web developers have sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever_._ Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and maintain. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    There is a new and better way to build the web. For people who been building
    the web since the 1990s, it may remind you a lot of the old way. Led by
    frameworks such as Gatsby, the rise of managed services, and the emergence
    of dynamic platforms like Netlify, we are now in the early stages of a
    Category 5 storm that is quickly and dramatically changing how and what we
    build. Achievements that were extremely difficult even 2-3 years ago are now
    becoming magically simple. Better yet, building this next generation of
    websites and applications is simply fun in way that we have been missing for
    a long time.

        You need to understand nature. A thin, and let me say that again, a THIN
        layer of liquid clear.

        Don't want to set these clouds on fire. Wind it up, blend it together.
        Painting used to drive me crazy. Sometimes it's fun to play little games
        in your mountains.
