    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and secure. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    This change is not about any one technology or JavaScript framework. Instead
    it is a fundamental shift in how we think (thanks largely to the tools and
    infrastructure we now have available.) Today we can build faster and smarter
    websites that are less costly to build, easier to maintain and secure, and
    infinitely more flexible than our current status quo. We have officially
    entered the era of JavaScript, managed services, microservices, the headless
    CMS, and the [content
    mesh](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/).
    It is going to be AWESOME.

    Finally there is a smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), along
    with modern platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the rise
    of the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), we are quickly and dramatically
    changing how and what we build. Similar to the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have widespread access to electric light, improved ways of making steel,
    railroad networks, and interchangeable parts.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. This site is
        powered by Gatsby, and it is also one of its primary topics of
        discussion.

        Gatsby is a modern marvel, and it is based on React. This is a good
        thing, and Gatsby is actually an ideal way to begin learning React.
        Anything you can do in React, you can do in Gatsby.
