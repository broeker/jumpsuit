    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better.[^1]
    But today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and secure. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    The future is not about any one technology or JavaScript framework. [^2]
    Instead we are facing a fundamental shift in how we think and build. Today
    we can build faster and smarter websites that are less costly to build,
    easier to maintain and secure, and infinitely more flexible than our current
    status quo. We have officially entered the era of JavaScript, managed
    services, microservices, the headless CMS, and the [content
    mesh](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/).
    It is going to be AWESOME.

    Finally there is a smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), along
    with modern platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the rise
    of the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) and the headless CMS, we are
    quickly and dramatically changing how and what we build. Similar to the
    real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have widespread access to electric light, improved ways of making steel,
    railroad networks, and interchangeable parts.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. This site is
        powered by Gatsby, and it is also one of its primary topics of
        discussion.

        Gatsby is a modern marvel, and it is based on React. This is a good
        thing, and Gatsby is actually an ideal way to begin learning React.
        Anything you can do in React, you can do in Gatsby.

        Netlify represents one of the newest and most well-known solutions for
        hosting and deployment, making simplicity and power the normal state of
        affairs in what is otherwise a typically complicated and expensive world
        to navigate.

        Content is king and for many projects you are still going to require
        some method to manage all of your content, images, and data. Welcome to
        the exploding world of the Headless CMS.

        From day one the web has been pushed forward by explorers and tinkerers
        who make up our own rules as we go. Yet if you look around, vast
        portions of the web are now powered by a monolithic CMS such as
        [Drupal](https://drupal.org) or [WordPress](https:\\wordpress.org) (or
        one of their many competitors both OSS and propietary.) We have now been
        using the same basic rules and techniques for decades (thanks in no
        small part to tinkerers like Dries Buytaert and Matt Mullenweg..)  And
        there is no dispute that these tools are more powerful and capable than
        ever. We can build anything.


        But all of this power comes at a high price: Increasing complexity and
        cost. Ever-present security threats. Long build cycles. Painfully slow
        and cumbersome user interfaces. Laborious and error prone update
        processes. Constant battles with performance, caching, and scaling. And,
        yes, some real limitations (Drupal or WordPress are both extremely
        great, until they are not.)


        Drupal and WordPress will likely be around for a long time. But thanks
        to a new generation of rule breakers like [Ryan Dahl
        (Node)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl) and [Jordan Walke
        (React)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)) and[
        Kyle Matthews
        (Gatsby)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributors/kyle-mathews/) and a
        long list of pioneers before them, we now have a path forward that
        promises fundamental improvements in how we work, what we build, and the
        value we provide to our clients and to the web.


        For the youngest and smartest of the new generation of web developers,
        none of this is news. But for the rest of us, we are now firmly in the
        middle of an unavoidable sea change that is going to turn everything
        upside down, again. Thankfully, the barrier to entry is approaching
        zero.


        My life-long fascination with the World Wide Web began in mid-1994.
        Armed with a fresh install of the Mosiac browser and a 14K internet
        connection, I pushed my first index.html file up to a
        univeristy-provided FTP server in mid-1994. I have been "viewing source"
        and slinging DIVs and configuring ODBC connections and helping make the
        the web work since that day forward.


        When I pushed up my first single page web app in the form a single
        index.html to a mysterious boomboox.umn.edu FTP server in 1994, myself
        and the rest of the world learned almost exclusivley by viewing the
        source.


        The best part of this of this new world is how easy it is to get
        started, and to experiment and learn.

  spirit of goodness, and in acknowledgment of the absurd.


  [^2]: This website focuses on Gatsby and React, because I think they are best.
  But if you love Vue I'd encourage to explore Gridsome. I am unaware of any
  Angular equivalents.
