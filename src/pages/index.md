    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and maintain. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    Today we can build better, faster, and smarter web applications that are
    less costly to build, quicker to develop, easier to maintain and support,
    and more flexible than our current status quo. This new world is not about a
    specific tool, or any particular framework (well, except it IS all about
    JavaScript.) Rather it is defined by a new and different way of thinking
    about how we build the web. Best yet, building this next generation of
    websites and applications is simply fun in way that we have been missing for
    a long time.

  intro: >-
    There is a new and smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    Gatsby and React, the rise of managed services, and the emergence of dynamic
    platforms like Netlify, we are now in the early stages of a second
    Industrial Revolution that is quickly and dramatically changing how and what
    we build. Achievements that were extremely difficult even 2-3 years ago are
    now becoming simple. Similar to the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have access to electric light, better ways of making steel, railroads,
    and interchangeable parts.

        I was first introduced to Gatsby JS at BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby
        founder Kyle Matthews. At the time I was mildly impressed, and made a
        note to further investigate the growing popularity of "static" site
        generators.

        You need to understand nature. A thin, and let me say that again, a THIN
        layer of liquid clear.
