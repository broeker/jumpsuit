    From the dawn of time, web developers have sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage. Less fun to work on. Everything has become MORE
    complicated, not less.

    When we started building the web more than a quarter of a century ago,
    things were simple. And fun. We built things by hand, with intention. Every
    piece of hand-coded markup had a purpose. The world was filled with optimism
    and incredible potential. We collectively and rapidly created an entire new
    universe of pages and links and resources and tools. It was fun.

        Don't want to set these clouds on fire. Wind it up, blend it together.
        Painting used to drive me crazy. Sometimes it's fun to play little games
        in your mountains.

        You need to understand nature. A thin, and let me say that again, a THIN
        layer of liquid clear.
