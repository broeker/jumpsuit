    From the dawn of time, web developers have sought to make things better.
    Instead our lives have become more difficult. Our projects are more
    expensive. More difficult to manage.  Everything has become MORE
    complicated, not less.

    Imagine a world where our tools are [simple and easy to
    use](http://google.com). A world content -- not content management -- comes
    first A world where clients enjoy interacting with their website, and where
    developers **discover joy** in building.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
