  title: Why Kaldi
  description: >-
    Jumpsuits to me represent many diverse qualities from action and adventure
    to manual labor. Jumpsuits are worn by people who push the envelope like
    skydivers, downhill skiers, astronauts, and high speed racers. Also, people
    incarcerated in institutions that are full of life’s most dangerous
    criminals who made their own rules

  Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
  java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee production,
  roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that knowledge to
  anyone.

        We sell green and roasted coffee beans that are sourced directly from

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and
        local communities. Check our post or contact us directly for current

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
