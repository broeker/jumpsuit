    From the dawn of time, web developers have sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more expensive
    and harder to manage. Less fun to build. Slower and more complicated to use.
    And way less fun to fly.

    For more than a quarter of a century, the vast majority our effort has been
    focused almost entirely on the backend: early CGI scripts led to the first
    "database-driven" websites and finally to the rise of the content management
    system. Drupal and other next generation backend frameworks may play a
    central role in this new world, but they are now a secondary concern. 


    On the modern web, data comes not only from Drupal or WordPress but from
    external APIs, managed web services, spreadsheets, and more. It does not
    matter. 



    The backend has been solved, and is now fully commoditized. For the first
    time in history, our singular focus is on the frontend. Our job is the user
    interface, and nothing more. We are here to create fast, effective digital
    experiences regardless of the device, the content, or the context. This is
    our only job, and the only thing that matters.

  intro: >-
    We can do better. And in just the last 5 years, the landscape has changed
    dramatically in ways that are fundamentally changing how and what we build.
    Traditional and monolithic platforms like Drupal and WordPress are no longer
    the obvious or default solutions. 


    It is now just a matter of time before MOST websites and web applications
    are built on something other than a traditional, server-based content
    management system. 


    Similar to the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have widespread access to electric light, improved ways of making steel,
    interchangeable parts, and a growing network of railroads at our disposal.
    Led by frameworks such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/),
    [Next](https://www.nextjs.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/), along
    with modern platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the rise of
    the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), and the [headless
    CMS](https://headlesscms.org/), things that were very difficult even 2-3
    years ago are now easy.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. This site is
        powered by Gatsby, and it is also one of its primary topics of
        discussion.

        Gatsby is a modern marvel, and it is based on React. This is a good
        thing, and Gatsby is actually an ideal way to begin learning React.
        Anything you can do in React, you can do in Gatsby.

        Netlify represents one of the newest and most well-known solutions for
        hosting and deployment, making simplicity and power the normal state of
        affairs in what is otherwise a typically complicated and expensive world
        to navigate.

        Content is king and for many projects you are still going to require
        some method to manage all of your content, images, and data. Welcome to
        the exploding world of the Headless CMS.

        From day one, the web has been pushed forward by explorers and tinkerers
        who make up the rules as they go. Thanks to a new generation of rule
        breakers, we now have a path forward that promises fundamental
        improvements in how we work, what we build, and the experience we
        provide to our users. 


        As a result, we can now create faster and smarter web applications that
        are less costly to build, easier to maintain and secure, and infinitely
        more flexible than our current server-based status quo. 


        This website is dedicated to the jumpsuit life, to the brave souls, the
        learners, the curious, and the test pilots who continue to break
        barriers on our never-ending journey toward a better web.

  \[^1]: Here is the footnote.


  \[^2]:GThe future is not about any one technology or JavaScript framework or a
  cool new hosting platform.


  \[^3]: Vast portions of the web are now powered by a monolithic CMS such as
  Drupal or WordPress (or one of their many competitors both open source and
  proprietary.) And there is no dispute that these tools are more powerful and
  capable than ever. We can almost build anything, and there is a reason for the
  rise and ongoing success of the traditional CMS model.

  But all of this power comes at a high price: 

  Increasing complexity and cost. 

  Ever-present security threats. 

  Long build cycles. 

  Slow and cumbersome user interfaces. 

  Laborious and error prone update processes. 

  Constant battles with performance, caching, and scaling. 

  And, yes, some real limitations in terms of flexibility or the ability to
  expand beyond the world of your chosen CMS (Drupal or WordPress are both
  extremely great, until they are not.)


  \[^4] I only mention these three because they are so relevant to this website,
  and to many websites. Dries Buytaert. Linus Torvalds. Matt Mulli. Dave Winer.
  etc etc we owe them all.

  We have officially entered the era of JavaScript, managed services,
  microservices, the headless CMS, and the [content
  mesh](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/).
  It is going to be AWESOME.


  My life-long fascination with the World Wide Web began in mid-1994. Armed with
  a fresh install of the Mosiac browser and a 14K internet connection, I pushed
  my first index.html file up to a univeristy-provided FTP server in mid-1994. I
  have been "viewing source" and slinging DIVs and configuring ODBC connections
  and helping make the the web work since that day forward.


  When I pushed up my first single page web app in the form a single index.html
  to a mysterious boomboox.umn.edu FTP server in 1994, myself and the rest of
  the world learned almost exclusivley by viewing the source.


  The best part of this of this new world is how easy it is to get started, and
  to experiment and learn.






  Because the truth is that we are no longer building websites at all. We are
  building user interfaces.


  The job of the modern web developer is simple. We are here to create amazing
  user experiences that are accessible, responsive, and device agnostic. The
  data, the CMS, and all of the rules and business logic necessary to manage a
  modern website or mobile application is now mostly irrelevant to the real job
  at hand. 



  For more than a quarter of a century, the vast majority our effort has been
  focused almost entirely on the backend: early CGI scripts led to the first
  "database-driven" websites and finally to the rise of the content management
  systems.


  , and the delightful tools and user experiences that help people on their
  journey through the massively complicated array of websites and apps and
  digital signage and the Internet of Things we have woven over the past 25
  years.


  There are many paths forward, but the tools and concepts outlined below are a
  good place to start. My own path here began in 1994 during the web's infancy,
  and I have now survived:


  * Mosiac, Gopher, Archie, Veronica, and Usenet

  * The invention of TABLES, CSS (and early JavaScript)

  * The Browser Wars

  * The rise of blogging and the indie web

  * The Box Model

  * Spacer GIFs

  * The Platform Wars (Java vs Flash vs ASP.NET vs Cold Fusion vs. PHP vs Rails)

  * The Rise and Domination of the Open Source CMS

  * The invention of Gmail (along with AJAX, and subsequently JQuery)

  * The rise of mobile, and mobile applications 

  * The invention of the Cloud and SaaS


  I have loved every minute of it, largely because the airplanes keep getting
  better, and the because both the promise and the realities of the web
  continues to evolve at the speed of the sound. I encountered Gatsby JS and the
  concept of the JAMStack for the first time at Badcamp 2018, and...
