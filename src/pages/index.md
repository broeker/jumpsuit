    From the dawn of time, web developers have sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and maintain. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    Today we can build faster and smarter websites and applications. They are
    quicker and less costly to build, easier to maintain and support, and more
    flexible than our current status quo. For the youngest and smartest
    generation of web developers, none of this is news. For everybody else,
    there is a sea change underway. We have officially entered the era of
    JavaScript, managed services, microservices, the headless CMS, and the
    [content
    mesh](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/).
    All of us now face a fundamental shift in how we think about building the
    web \[^1], and it is going to be AWESOME.

  intro: >-
    There is a new and smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) along
    with modern platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the rise
    of the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), we are quickly and dramatically
    changing how and what we build. Similar to the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have access to electric light, better ways of making steel, railroads,
    and interchangeable parts.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. This site is
        powered by Gatsby, and it is also one of its primary topics of
        discussion.

        Gatsby is a modern marvel, and it is based on React. This is a good
        thing, and Gatsby is actually an ideal way to begin learning React.
        Anything you can do in React, you can do in Gatsby.
