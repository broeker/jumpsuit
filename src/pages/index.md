    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better.[^1]
    But today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and secure. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    The world you are about to enter is not about any one technology or
    JavaScript framework or cool new kid on the block.\[^2]  Instead it is a
    fundamental shift in how we think and build. Today we can build faster and
    smarter websites that are less costly to build, easier to maintain and
    secure, and infinitely more flexible than our current status quo. We have
    officially entered the era of JavaScript, managed services, microservices,
    the headless CMS, and the [content
    mesh](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/).
    It is going to be AWESOME.

    Finally there is a smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), along
    with modern platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and the rise
    of the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) and the headless CMS, we are
    quickly and dramatically changing how and what we build. Similar to the
    real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have widespread access to electric light, improved ways of making steel,
    railroad networks, and interchangeable parts.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. This site is
        powered by Gatsby, and it is also one of its primary topics of
        discussion.
    - heading: React JS

        Gatsby is a modern marvel, and it is based on React. This is a good
        thing, and Gatsby is actually an ideal way to begin learning React.
        Anything you can do in React, you can do in Gatsby.
    - heading: Netlify (and friends)

      text: >-
        Netlify represents one of the newest and most well-known solutions for
        hosting and deployment, making simplicity and power the normal state of
        affairs in what is otherwise a typically complicated and expensive world
        to navigate.

      text: >-
        Content is king and for many projects you are still going to require
        some method to manage all of your content, images, and data. Welcome to
        the exploding world of the Headless CMS.

  [^1]: Please know that every word written on this website is written in the
  spirit of goodness, and in acknowledgment of the absurd,


  [^2]: This website focuses on Gatsby and React, because I think they are best.
  But if you love Vue I'd encourage to explore Gridsome. I am unaware of any
  Angular equivalents.
