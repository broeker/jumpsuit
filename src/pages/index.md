    Most of the world has been building the web using the same basic technique
    for more than 20 years: monolithic, database-driven content management
    systems  When we started building the web more than a quarter of a century
    ago, things were simple. And fun. We built things by hand, with intention.
    Every piece of hand-coded markup had a purpose. The world was filled with
    optimism and incredible potential. With the help of view-source, we
    collectively and rapidly created an entire new universe of page and links
    and resources and tools that today represent the collective sum of human
    knowledge as we know it and the 
  heading: A race to the future.

  Imagine a world where our tools are [simple and easy to
  use](http://google.com). A world content -- not content management -- comes
  first A world where clients enjoy interacting with their website, and where
  developers **discover joy** in building.
