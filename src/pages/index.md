    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and maintain. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    Today we can build better, faster, and smarter web applications. They are
    less costly to build, quicker to develop, easier to maintain and support,
    and more flexible than our current status quo. This new world is not about a
    specific tool, or any particular framework. Rather it is about Javascript,
    and a new and different way of thinking about how we build the web. Best
    yet, building this next generation of websites and applications is simply
    fun in way that we have been missing for a long time.

  intro: >-
    There is a new and smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    Gatsby and React,  dynamic platforms like Netlify, and the rise of managed
    services we are now in the early stages of a Second Industrial Revolution
    that is quickly and dramatically changing how and what we build. Similar to
    the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have access to electric light, better ways of making steel, railroads,
    and interchangeable parts. Achievements that were extremely difficult even
    2-3 years ago are now becoming simple.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. At the time I
        was mildly impressed, and made a note to further investigate the growing
        popularity of "static" site generators.

        Choose React. It is over. [React has won](https://reactjs.org/).
        WordPress and Drupal. Choose React. It is over. React has won. WordPress
        and Drupal. Choose React. It is over. React has won. WordPress and
        Drupal. Choose React. It is over. React has won. WordPress and Drupal.
