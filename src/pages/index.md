    From the dawn of time, web developers have tried to to make things better.
    But today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive and harder to manage. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use. And way less fun to fly.

    The backend has been solved, and is now fully commoditized. For the first
    time in history, our singular focus is on the `frontend.` Our job is the
    `user interface.` Nothing more. We are here to create fast, effective
    digital experiences regardless of the device, the content, or the context.
    This is our only job, and the only thing that matters. 


    For more than a quarter of a century, the vast majority of our effort has
    been focused almost entirely on the backend: early `CGI scripts` led to the
    first `database-driven websites` and finally to the rise of the `CMS`, and
    the `web-as-a-service.` Drupal and other backend frameworks may play a
    central role in this new world, but they are now a secondary concern. 


    On the modern web, data comes not only from Drupal or WordPress but from
    external APIs, managed web services, spreadsheets, and more. It does not
    matter.

    But in just the last 5 years, the landscape has shifted dramatically in ways
    that are fundamentally changing how and what we build. Monolithic platforms
    like Drupal and WordPress are no longer the obvious or default solution (nor
    are traditional applications built on .NET, Rails, or Laravel.)


    It is now just a matter of time before MOST websites and web applications
    are built on something other than a traditional, server-based content
    management system or backend framework.


    Similar to the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have widespread access to electric light, improved ways of making steel,
    interchangeable parts, and a growing network of railroads at our disposal.
    Led by frameworks such as [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/),
    [Next](https://www.nextjs.org/), and [React](https://reactjs.org/), along
    with modern platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the rise of
    the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), and the [headless
    CMS](https://headlesscms.org/), things that were very difficult even 2-3
    years ago are now easy.
