    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and maintain. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    Today we can build faster and smarter web applications that are less costly
    to build, quicker to market, easier to maintain and support, and more
    flexible than our current status quo. Best yet, building this next
    generation of websites and applications is simply fun in way that web
    developers have been missing for a very long time.

  intro: >-
    There is a new and smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    Gatsby JS, dynamic platforms like Netlify, and the rise of managed services
    we are now in the early stages of Category 5 storm that is quickly and
    dramatically changing how and what we build. Similar to the real-life
    [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have access to electric light, better ways of making steel, railroads,
    and interchangeable parts.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. This site is
        powered by Gatsby, and it is also one of its primary topics of
        discussion.

      text: >-
        Gatsby is a modern marvel, and it is based on React. This is a good
        thing, and Gatsby is actually an ideal way to begin learning React.
        Anything you can do in React, you can do in Gatsby.
