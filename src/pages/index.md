    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better.[^1]
    But today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and secure. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    The future is not about any one technology or JavaScript framework or cool
    new hosting platform.[^2]   Instead, we are facing a fundamental shift in
    how we build and think about the web. We can now create faster and smarter
    websites and applications that are less costly to build, easier to maintain
    and secure, and infinitely more flexible than our current status quo.

    Now there is a smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), along
    with modern platforms like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), the rise of
    the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), and the [headless
    CMS](https://headlesscms.org/), we are quickly and dramatically changing how
    and what we build. Similar to the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have widespread access to electric light, improved ways of making steel,
    interchangeable parts, and a growing network of railroads at our disposal.

        I was first introduced to [Gatsby JS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) at a
        BadCamp session in 2018 by Gatsby founder Kyle Matthews. This site is
        powered by Gatsby, and it is also one of its primary topics of
        discussion.

        Gatsby is a modern marvel, and it is based on React. This is a good
        thing, and Gatsby is actually an ideal way to begin learning React.
        Anything you can do in React, you can do in Gatsby.

        Netlify represents one of the newest and most well-known solutions for
        hosting and deployment, making simplicity and power the normal state of
        affairs in what is otherwise a typically complicated and expensive world
        to navigate.

        Content is king and for many projects you are still going to require
        some method to manage all of your content, images, and data. Welcome to
        the exploding world of the Headless CMS.

        From day one, the web has been pushed forward by explorers and tinkerers
        who make up rules as they go. Many of the tools and techniques we have
        access to in 2019 were not even conceivable even five short years ago.
        And yet many of use are still relying on the same basic tools and
        techniques that have been in place for decades.[^3]


        Thankfully  a new generation of rule breakers like [Ryan Dahl
        (Node)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Dahl) and [Jordan Walke
        (React)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)) and[
        Kyle Matthews
        (Gatsby)](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/contributors/kyle-mathews/) and a
        long list of pioneers before them, we now have a path forward that
        promises fundamental improvements in how we work, what we build, and the
        value we provide to our clients and to the web.


        For the youngest and smartest of the new generation of web developers,
        none of this is news. But for the rest of us, we are now firmly in the
        middle of an unavoidable sea change that is going to turn everything
        upside down, again. Thankfully, the barrier to entry is approaching
        zero.

  [^1]: Here is the footnote.


  [^2]: Here's one with multiple blocks.


  [^3]: Vast portions of the web are now powered by a monolithic CMS such as
  Drupal or WordPress (or one of their many competitors both open source and
  proprietary.) And there is no dispute that these tools are more powerful and
  capable than ever. We can almost build anything, and there is a reason for the
  rise and ongoing success of the traditional CMS model.

  But all of this power comes at a high price: 

  Increasing complexity and cost. 

  Ever-present security threats. 

  Long build cycles. 

  Slow and cumbersome user interfaces. 

  Laborious and error prone update processes. 

  Constant battles with performance, caching, and scaling. 

  And, yes, some real limitations in terms of flexibility or the ability to
  expand beyond the world of your chosen CMS (Drupal or WordPress are both
  extremely great, until they are not.)




  We have officially entered the era of JavaScript, managed services,
  microservices, the headless CMS, and the [content
  mesh](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/).
  It is going to be AWESOME.




  My life-long fascination with the World Wide Web began in mid-1994. Armed with
  a fresh install of the Mosiac browser and a 14K internet connection, I pushed
  my first index.html file up to a univeristy-provided FTP server in mid-1994. I
  have been "viewing source" and slinging DIVs and configuring ODBC connections
  and helping make the the web work since that day forward.


  When I pushed up my first single page web app in the form a single index.html
  to a mysterious boomboox.umn.edu FTP server in 1994, myself and the rest of
  the world learned almost exclusivley by viewing the source.


  The best part of this of this new world is how easy it is to get started, and
  to experiment and learn.
