    From the dawn of time, web developers hath sought to make things better. But
    today our world is more difficult than ever. Our projects are more
    expensive. Harder to manage and maintain. Less fun to build. Slower and more
    complicated to use.

    Today we can be build better, faster, and smarter web applications that are
    less costly to build, quicker to develop, easier to maintain and support,
    and more flexible than our current status quo. Better yet, building this
    next generation of websites and applications is simply fun in way that we
    have been missing for a long time.

    There is a new and smarter way to build the web. Led by frameworks such as
    Gatsby and React, the rise of managed services, and the emergence of dynamic
    platforms like Netlify, we are now in the early stages of a second
    Industrial Revolution that is quickly and dramatically changing how and what
    we build. Achievements that were extremely difficult even 2-3 years ago are
    now becoming simple. Similar to the real-life [Second Industrial
    Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution), we
    now have access to electric light, better ways of making steel, railroads,
    and interchangeable parts.

        Don't want to set these clouds on fire. Wind it up, blend it together.
        Painting used to drive me crazy. Sometimes it's fun to play little games
        in your mountains.

        You need to understand nature. A thin, and let me say that again, a THIN
        layer of liquid clear.
