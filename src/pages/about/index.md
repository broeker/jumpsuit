Welcome to my website and blog, wherein we discuss Gatsby, React, the JAMstack, and better living through the jumpsuit lifestyle. My name is Tim Broeker (aka Citizen Tim.) I began building web the in 1994. My first browser was an early copy of Mosiac.

Today I am the co-founder and technical director of a great digital agency in Minneapolis, MN called Electric Citizen. We serve the public sector, and work to help mission-driven organizations do good things. 

My life has been guided and influenced by a legion of people much smarter and more talented than myself, and I owe my career to an early understanding of "view-source" and an enduring passion to do something cool. 

### A Not-So-Brief Timeline

* I graduated from high school in 1987 and spent three years wandering the Midwest, the west coast, the Pacific Northwest, the Great Plains and other far flung fields wondering who to be. 
* I returned to Minnesota in 1991 and enrolled as an extension student for winter quarter at the University of Minnesota. They assigned me an "email" address. 
* Within a year or so, I became a full-time student and eventually enrolled in the School of Journalism, and quickly began a 4 year tenure as a news reporter and editor at the Minnesota Daily. These were some of the greatest years of my life.
* During the night of the primary elections of 1994, one of the staff computer nerds introduced me to the World Wide Web, and showed me how to access a list of live election results from a URL that had been printed in one of the local dailies.
* The next morning, I waited in line to buy a 14K Baud modem for my IBM ThinkPad at the university bookstore. After an epic battle to get it installed and connected to my new ISP, I stayed up until 3AM until I had successfully loaded a file called "index.html" to my university-provided ~/broeker account on  boombox.umn.edu.
* I did not leave my room for the next three years. 
* In late 1994 I became the founding online editor of our website, and along with an extremely talented team, launched what was then only the third daily newspaper in the country launch a website that was publishing the entirety of its printed edition to the web. (We created a program in PERL -- called the "cooker" -- that extracted data from the Quark Express system used to output our print edition. It was a spectacular achievement.

### Single origin

Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming

Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing

Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits

We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâ€™s why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
